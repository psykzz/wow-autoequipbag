# AutoEquipBag

> Very simple small addon that auto equips bags into empty slots

## How
When looting new items, checks if there are empty bag slots.
If there are, it will search through your inventory for a spare bag and try to equip it.

If there are no bags, nothing happens.

## Anything else
Nope thats the entire thing. You can review the code [directly](https://github.com/psykzz/wow-autoequipbag/blob/main/core.lua).
